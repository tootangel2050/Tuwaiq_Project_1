# introduction
- Cooking is one of the basic skills that must be learned on both sides. For men, they have to travel, and find it difficult to order food, and sometimes they do not like food in the place where they are. If they are good at cooking something, this will save them a lot of time and effort. For women, it is preferable. Learn new recipes and dishes, as this adds an atmosphere of fun and innovation.
