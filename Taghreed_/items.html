        <p><B>The ingredients:</B>
          2 ounces rice vermicelli
          8 rice wrappers (8.5 inch diameter)
          8 large cooked shrimp - peeled, deveined and cut in half
          1 ⅓ tablespoons chopped fresh Thai basil
          3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves

        <p><B>The ingredients:</B>

          1 large russet potato, peeled and cut into large chunks
          1 tbsp. ghee
          1 tsp. cumin seeds
          1 green chili, diced
          2 tsp. freshly grated ginger
          1 tsp. garam masala
          1 tsp. turmeric
          1/2 tsp. asafoetida

          1/2 c. frozen pea, thawed
          1/4 c. chopped fresh cilantro
          Kosher salt
          FOR DOUGH
          2 c. all-purpose flour
          1 tsp. ajwain seeds
          1/2 tsp. kosher salt
          4 tbsp. melted ghee
          6 tbsp. ice water
          Vegetable oil, for frying
          Mint chutney, for serving<br><br>
          <B> How to prepare:</B>

          Make the filling: Place potato into a medium pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes
          are fork tender, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Use a fork to smash potatoes into smaller chunks with still some
          bigger pieces remaining.
          In a medium skillet, melt ghee over medium heat. Add cumin and cook until darkened and fragrant, about 1
          minute. Add green chili and ginger and cook, stirring, 1 minute more. Add potatoes and spices and toss to
          coat. Stir in peas and cilantro and season with salt to taste. Remove from heat and let cool.
          Make the dough: In a large bowl, combine flour, ajwain seeds, and salt. Add ghee and ice water and stir until
          dough comes together. Adding more water 1 tablespoon at a time as needed until dough holds together easily
          without feeling sticky. Form into a disc and cover in plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for 30
          minutes.
          Make the samosas: Divide dough into 6 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Work with one ball of
          dough at a time and keep remaining dough covered with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out.
          Roll each piece of dough into an oval that’s ¼” thick and about 7” long and 5” wide. Cut in half crosswise.
          Wet the cut side of dough with a little water and bring the edges together to form a cone, pressing to seal.
          (Check the tip is sealed as well.) Hold the cone in one hand and fill with about 1 tablespoon of filling. Wet
          the edges with more water and press together to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
          Fill a large, heavy- bottomed pot with about 2” of oil and fit with a deep fry thermometer. Place over medium
          heat until oil reaches 350°. A small piece of dough dropped into the oil should take a few seconds to start
          bubbling and rise to the surface. Without overcrowding the pot, working in batches if necessary, add samosas
          to oil and fry, turning occasionally, until deeply golden, about 10 to 12 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary
          to keep oil at 350°F. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer samosas to a paper towel-lined plate as they
          are ready. Let cool slightly before serving.
          Serve warm with chutney.
